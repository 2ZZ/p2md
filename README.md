# Page to Markdown

This is a Chrome extension to convert the currently loaded page to a Markdown file.
I made this for automatically adding pages as notes into [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).
All the magic conversion is done in [Mercury Parser](https://github.com/postlight/mercury-parser).
Expect to get good results on popular sites like [Medium](https://medium.com), but many will produce mediocre results.
